# Virtual-Heap

## Design for Virtual Memory Allocation on Static Memory 
In this program we try to design a simple version of virtual heap on static memory and provide safe threaded processing on the shared virtual heap. 

## Data Structure

### Physical memory: 
Preallocated static memory with total size of 1MB.\
Page size: 4096 bytes = 4 KB\
Number of pages: 256\
PM size: 1 MB (256 * 4KB)\

### Virtual memory: 
Page size: 4 KB\
Number of page: 256 * 2\
VM size: 2 MB\

### Backing store bin: 
Disk that holds the data for virtual memory when the physical memory is full.
